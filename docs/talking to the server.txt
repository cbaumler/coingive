Communication is done using JSON. Send a request message formatted in JSON, and the server will either send a response or error message also formatted in JSON.

All request messages have the "messageId" property. All response messages (including errors) have the "responseId" property. Errors always have a responseId of 0.
Message payload data is held in the "data" property. For example, to view the error message in an error response, you would use
message->data->errorMessage.

errorMessage	string - says what went wrong
